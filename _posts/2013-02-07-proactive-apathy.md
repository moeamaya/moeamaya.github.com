Finally starting to put down some ideas for my thesis topic. 

<h2>///POLEMIC///</h2>
We can be rightfully described as a generation of apathetic, earest, students

Ideas are free, architects implement

<h2>///QUESTIONS///</h2>
Why is every architectural resource closed?

What does this say about our discipline? Implicit Authorship?
