Bready malt tastes at the outset turn sweet and caramel-like, then grainy. Toasted malt tastes of bread crust creep in toward the end of the malt onslaught. Hop tastes of grass and hay provide balance. Quick flare of earthy/spicy hop tastes and a flash of citrus elaborate. Nutty earthiness now seems like more of a malt nuance than a yeast contribution. Finishes with tastes of grain, bread crust, and grass.


<div class="rating"><span>CRITIQUE</span>9 / 10</div>
The general thematic of open sourced content continues to develop as a potential topic for my thesis. I built this blog, which will trace my findings and research through this domain, with an open source tool and am hosting the content on an explicitly open source platform. I was able to design, build, and deploy this site in 4 hours, exploiting the power of open source. Jekyll thus far has been exactly what I am looking for, spending only 10% of my time coding, while allowing me to design all the little details that interest me. I will probably bump the 9-rating once I spend more time with Jekyll.
