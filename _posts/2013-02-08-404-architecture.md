With all the books and papers I have been sifting through, the piece that seems to keep lingering at the the back of my head is the one in Google's quarterly design magazine, [Think Quarterly](http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/quarterly/open/the-future-is-open.html).
<br>
The article describes a series of disciplines who have acknowledged the usefulness of open source to solve problems of varying importance and complexity. In an Open Government where municipal transparency is the default, citizens feel enabled to engage the political process through open access to information and data. 
<br>
While building [Atlas](http://agile-sands-2491.herokuapp.com/), we found it impossible to access information for Architecture in any format other than more general sources. How can our discipline which purports the user as its primary influence, not allow free access to data? We could improve research, viability, design quality, efficiency, and a wide range of other metrics which the discipline traditionally struggles with.
