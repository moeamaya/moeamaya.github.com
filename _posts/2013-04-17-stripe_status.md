<div class="post-content">
Design re-implementation for Stripe's API status page.

    <div class="rating">01 <p>Current Status</p></div>
     I believe the clarity of the current implementation makes sense. If a problem does arise it will be plainly stated as the first element on the page.
    
    <div class="rating">02 <p>Dependability</p></div>
    Since Stripes deals with money, I want to reassure site owners and developers that the site&#39;s uptime is of prominent importance.
    
    <div class="rating">03 <p>Incidents</p></div>
    Expose issues, everyone has downtime. I want to be able to quickly see the most recent incidents. I don&#39;t really care about problems that happened 3 months ago (if I do, I can search through the archives).
