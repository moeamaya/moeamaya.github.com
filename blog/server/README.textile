h1. Craft & Critique Blog

I forked "Tom Preston-Werner's blog":https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com and added paginate. With Jekyll, it's incredibly easy to format and design your blog as it's essentially a static site. If you're tired of the bloat and slowness of Wordpress, tumblr, etc., try jekyll. I can't speak of it highly enough.

Details: The site is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.
