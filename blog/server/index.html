Discovered through a local beer tasting. Poured into a wide mug. Nearly zero head with a deep almond tone. Beginning with a wooded scent, the casking process remains embedded. Complex with flavors of bread, malt, and citrus that end with a alcohol bite. Interesting backstory of a historic recipe from 1832 revived by the brewery.


<div class="rating"><span>CRITIQUE</span>6 / 10</div>
I had the chance to interview with Quora as a designer, and through this exercise I spent some time analyzing the current Quora question page. As a designer problem, Quora is situated firmly within the domain of typography, where one recognizes the abundance of information that is delivered primarily through text. I found the lack of consistency and over-presentation of information to be problematic, while the overall heirarchy seems too closely spaced. In reinterpretating I tried to split information more distinctly while removing barriers of consumption. The actionable items are still present but work with the layout rather than opposed to it. I think the Quora product is great, and hope they continue their substantial growth and improvement.

<p>With all the books and papers I have been sifting through, the piece that seems to keep lingering at the the back of my head is the one in Google's quarterly design magazine, <a href="http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/quarterly/open/the-future-is-open.html">Think Quarterly</a>.</p>

<br>


<p>The article describes a series of disciplines who have acknowledged the usefulness of open source to solve problems of varying importance and complexity. In an Open Government where municipal transparency is the default, citizens feel enabled to engage the political process through open access to information and data.</p>

<br>


<p>While building <a href="http://agile-sands-2491.herokuapp.com/">Atlas</a>, we found it impossible to access information for Architecture in any format other than more general sources. How can our discipline which purports the user as its primary influence, not allow free access to data? We could improve research, viability, design quality, efficiency, and a wide range of other metrics which the discipline traditionally struggles with.</p>

Recommended to me by <a href="www.amdixon.com">Dixon</a>. Poured into a pint tumbler glass. Small head and clear with a honey hue. The aroma hints at citrus with a wheat baseline. Upon taste, the grapefruit comes forward and one can feel the hops emerge. Tastes similar to an IPA. Not my favorite beer, but also not bad for a Dixon recommendation.


<div class="rating"><span>CRITIQUE</span>9 / 10</div>
The general thematic of open sourced content continues to develop as a potential topic for my thesis. I built this blog, which will trace my findings and research through this domain, with an open source tool and am hosting the content on an explicitly open source platform. I was able to design, build, and deploy this site in 4 hours, exploiting the power of open source. Jekyll thus far has been exactly what I am looking for, spending only 10% of my time coding, while allowing me to design all the little details that interest me. I will probably bump the 9-rating once I spend more time with Jekyll.
