<div class="rating"><span>CRAFT</span>7 / 10</div>
Discovered through a local beer tasting. Poured into a wide mug. Nearly zero head with a deep almond tone. Beginning with a wooded scent, the casking process remains embedded. Complex with flavors of bread, malt, and citrus that end with a alcohol bite. Interesting backstory of a historic recipe from 1832 revived by the brewery.


<div class="rating"><span>CRITIQUE</span>6 / 10</div>
I had the chance to interview with Quora as a designer, and through this exercise I spent some time analyzing the current Quora question page. As a designer problem, Quora is situated firmly within the domain of typography, where one recognizes the abundance of information that is delivered primarily through text. I found the lack of consistency and over-presentation of information to be problematic, while the overall heirarchy seems too closely spaced. In reinterpretating I tried to split information more distinctly while removing barriers of consumption. The actionable items are still present but work with the layout rather than opposed to it. I think the Quora product is great, and hope they continue their substantial growth and improvement.
